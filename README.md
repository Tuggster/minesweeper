# minesweeper
A recreation of the classic version of Minesweeper, no extra bells or whistles.

# Why?
I wanted to play minesweeper while bored in class, but I didn't want ads or ugly modern renditions of the graphics.
They deserve a faithful, accurate, low-res recreation.

I hand-traced the graphics in photoshop and wrote all the game logic myself.

# 2025 and beyond
Added leaderboard support and more customization options in the settings dropdown.
